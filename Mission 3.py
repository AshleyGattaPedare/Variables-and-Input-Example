#You quickly realise that one of the scientists has a habit of writing IN ALL CAPS and it drives you insane. You've asked him to stop, but he's a mad man. 

#Step 1: Prompt the scientist to write a mission description using 'input.' Then in the print statement underneath, use the .lower function to make his writing lower case.

mission_description = input(
mission_description_lowercase = 
print(mission_description_lowercase)


#Step 2: NASA has a strict word count for how long a mission description can be. Keep it simple- it's not rocket science!:P 
#Use a print statement with the len function to find out how many characters are in the mission_description.

#Step 3: To create a top secret mission code for this project, you have been asked to take the first three letters of the mission name and the last three letters 
# of the mission name and combine them. 
# Below is an example from a previous mission where they used the second and second to last letters. 
       #Underneath the example have a go at making a mission code for the current mission.
