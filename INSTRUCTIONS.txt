It's your lucky day! 

All those years of listening to Miss Gatta and Mr. Zankov drone on and on and on about "getting good" with your coding skills are finally worth it because....(drum roll!)....
You have finally landed a job at the coolest place on (and off) earth- NASA.

As a junior software engineer, you need to complete a series of tasks to help the astronauts and scientists make important calculations. 
No pressure, but if you make a mistake, people could die in the endless vacuum of space where no one can hear them scream.

Good luck! And make sure to read the instructions CAREFULLY.

P.S. Remember your poor old haggard technology teachers when you're earning $1 million bucks a year (this is not a joke, donations are accepted here).
